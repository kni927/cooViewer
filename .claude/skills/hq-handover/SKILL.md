name: hq-handover
description: Hand this cloud HQ (Central HQ, Upstream HQ, or a Project HQ) over to a fresh cloud session, as docs/sessions.md "Cloud sessions" (Handover) describes. Use when docs/sessions.md "Context usage" calls for it (the threshold after the first compaction, or a second compaction) or when the owner says "handover".

# Hand over a cloud HQ

`docs/sessions.md` ("Context usage" and "Cloud sessions") is the rule;
this is the procedure. It applies to cloud HQs only. A local TF wraps up
instead (`/tf`, step 8).
An HQ with no work left and no successor needed goes on stand-by
(`💤`, "Stand-by" in `docs/sessions.md`) rather than handing over.

1. **Find a natural break.** Finish or stop the current step so the handover
   stays short. Read the context usage with `get_session` (no session ID).
2. **Leave the repositories clean.** Bring `docs/STATUS.md` up to date in
   each repository this HQ keeps (`docs/sessions.md`, Status files): open
   items and their state, what is on hold, what waits on the owner. In every
   repository this HQ changed, commit what belongs there and push it under
   that repository's rules (fetch, merge `origin/main` if it moved, then
   push). Note anything that cannot be pushed.
3. **Write the handover** in the owner's language, as the successor's first
   prompt, opening with the English first lines in `docs/sessions.md`
   (Messages, First lines; kind `handover`). Include:
   - the role, the plain name, and the repositories it works in;
   - what to do first: "Successor's first turn" below, and the repositories
     it attaches with `add_repo` without asking the owner (owner's decision,
     2026-10-22);
   - a pointer to the status files for open items and what waits on the
     owner, plus only what they cannot hold (session IDs, chat-only
     context);
   - the sessions it coordinates, by name (IDs may be included: the
     handover is sent, not committed);
   - recent decisions with their commits;
   - environment quirks met in this session.
   Leave out what the repositories already record and what the owner's
   personal preferences already say (how to address the owner, language,
   tone).
4. **Start the successor** through the Launcher (`launcher`, Asking the
   Launcher): title `☁️ ` and the plain name (for example `☁️ cooViewer HQ`),
   repository the project's for a Project HQ,
   `https://github.com/kni927/dotfiles` for Upstream HQ,
   `https://github.com/kni927/HQ` for Central HQ, and the handover as the
   prompt. The Launcher answers with the successor's ID. Starting it with
   `create_session` here instead would put the successor one level below this
   session; do that only when neither the Launcher nor Quarterdeck
   answers, with `permission_mode` `auto` and `source_revision` `main`. At the lineage
   limit with neither answering, save the handover to Google Drive
   `AI/Handoff/<Project>/handover-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and ask the owner, in one
   English line, to start the successor in claude.ai/code (`Trusted`, the
   repository above, auto mode, the title above) with the prompt "Read
   Google Drive AI/Handoff/<Project>/handover-YYYY-MM-DD.md and follow it."
   If auto mode refuses a call, tell the owner and keep working until it is
   resolved.
5. **Mark this session done.** Rename it with `set_session_title` to
   `☁️ ✅ <name> (handover YYYY-MM-DD)`, using the owner's local date, send
   the successor one line saying the handover is done (repositories
   pushed), and end the reply with the ready-to-archive block from
   `docs/sessions.md`. Then stop taking work. The successor does the rest
   in its first turn, so long tool output stays out of this nearly full
   context. Never archive this session yourself (`docs/sessions.md`,
   Stand-by).

## Successor's first turn

The owner decided on 2026-10-22 that a successor does these without asking,
as part of the handover. Open the first reply with the `This is` line
(`docs/sessions.md`, Messages, First lines). Do step 1 in this session. Then run steps 2 to 4
in one foreground `Agent` subagent, giving it the session names and IDs and
the predecessor's ID, so the long tool output (Routine prompts) stays out of
the main context; it returns a short report. Subagents can call the
claude-code-remote and connector tools (checked 2026-10-29). If a step is
refused, it says which and why.

1. Attach the repositories the handover lists with `add_repo`, clone each
   one at a time, and `register_repo_root` it. `add_repo` is allowed in
   settings (`cloud-setup.sh`), so a direct call passes auto mode; a
   subagent asked to add repositories with push access was refused as
   gaining access (2026-10-30), so this step stays out of the subagent.
2. Upstream HQ only: in Google Drive `AI/Status/Sessions/`, rename the one
   `upstream-hq.<session ID>` file (`update_file`, `title`) to carry this
   session's ID, and check that it is the only such file. claude-app-watch
   on the Macs sends its notices to the ID in that name.
3. **Routines.** With `list_triggers`, find those bound to the predecessor
   (`persistent_session_id`; Central HQ's morning check). Create each again
   bound to this session (same name, schedule, and prompt), then delete the
   old one. A Routine is bound to one session and cannot be rebound; the
   owner's fresh-session Routines need nothing. A session at the lineage limit
   cannot create Routines: then leave the old ones, and the report says so.
4. **Tell the others** with `send_message`, giving this session's name and
   ID, once: upstream (Central HQ; when Central HQ itself hands over,
   Upstream HQ) and downstream (the Project HQs or TFs it coordinates; a TF
   on the Mac cannot be reached from the cloud while that is refused, so use
   the Mac mini relay in `docs/sessions.md`).
5. When the predecessor's "handover done" line has arrived and step 3 left
   no Routine bound to it, check that its title carries `✅` and that its
   repositories have nothing unpushed (each `main` on GitHub holds the
   commits its "handover done" line names); then archive it with
   `archive_session` (allowed in settings by cloud-setup.sh) and tell the owner in one line,
   with anything the subagent could not do. If something is missing, ask the predecessor with
   `send_message` before archiving.
