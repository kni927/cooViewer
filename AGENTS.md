# Project Instructions

## Workflow

- The project owner defines tasks.
- Do not redefine, extend, or split tasks on your own.
- Architecture, requirements, and design direction are decided through chat.
- Implementation is driven by `TASK.md` at the repository root.
- Read `TASK.md` before making changes.
- Implement only the scope requested in `TASK.md`.
- Do not add unrelated features or refactor unrelated code unless explicitly instructed.
- Build the project after implementation.
- Perform reasonable tests and verification appropriate to the task.
- Update relevant documentation when necessary.

## Task Completion

- A task is considered finished when you stop work and report the result to the project owner.
- A task may be finished even if it is not fully successful. In that case, record the failure, limitations, and any newly discovered follow-up work.
- Follow the task completion and archiving procedure in docs/task-workflow.md.

## Interrupted Work

- Tasks and individual steps must be safe to resume after interruption
  (rate limits, connection loss, context compaction, process termination,
  or tool errors).
- On resumption, do not assume the last requested or reported step failed,
  and do not restart the task from the beginning.
- When determining execution progress, observable state is authoritative
  over prior reports or assumptions. Before repeating an operation, inspect
  the current repository and external state and continue from the first
  incomplete step.
- The original goal and acceptance criteria remain authoritative.
- Follow the interruption and recovery procedure in `docs/task-workflow.md`.

## Scope Control

- Do not implement features outside the requested scope unless explicitly instructed.
- Small changes required to build, test, or safely integrate the requested work are allowed.
- Record substantial newly discovered work as a follow-up issue rather than expanding the current task.

## Git Workflow

- Complete the implementation, build, and verification before creating a commit.
- Create one local commit for each completed task whenever practical.
- Use concise English commit messages.
- If a task cannot be fully completed, commit the completed work and clearly describe the remaining work in the task archive.
- Never push, create releases, or modify remote repositories unless explicitly instructed.
- Initial publication to GitHub and other significant push points are reviewed by the project owner.
- Direct branch merges are acceptable for small solo projects.
- Pull requests are not required unless explicitly requested.

## Documentation

- `docs/tasks/` contains the original task instructions and their implementation results.
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` contains unresolved, reproducible, and actionable problems.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md` contains notable project-level progress rather than detailed task history. Keep DEV_LOG.md concise. Record only major completed milestones.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` contains lasting architectural, technical, and product decisions.
- Avoid duplicating the same information across these files.
- Create `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, or `docs/DECISIONS.md` when the project grows enough to benefit from them. Once created, keep them updated when relevant.
- Do not modify `README.md` unless explicitly requested by the project owner.

## Language

- Communication and explanations to the project owner are primarily in Japanese.
- Source code, identifiers, code comments, UI text, logs, and commit messages are in English.
- Project documentation is written in English by default.
- Use Japanese documentation only when explicitly required by the project.
- Preserve the existing language and style when editing established documentation.

## Licensing

- Follow the project's primary license defined by the repository root license file.
- Preserve existing copyright notices, licenses, and attribution.
- Store additional third-party licenses and attribution documents under `docs/licenses/`.
- Ensure added third-party code or assets comply with the project's licensing requirements.

## Build

- Use repository-local build output under `build/`.
- Keep only final distributable products under `build/`.
- Store intermediate build files, caches, indexes, test products, and temporary artifacts outside the repository.
- Remove stale contents from `build/` before producing a new final product.
- Verify that `build/` contains only the intended final product after the build.
- Keep `build/` clean and easy to inspect.
- Verify that the built application launches successfully whenever practical.
- A task may override these rules if explicitly instructed.


## General Conventions

- Use English for filenames and identifiers.
- Follow the existing project structure and coding style.
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over unnecessary abstractions.
- Follow semantic versioning for tagged releases unless the project specifies otherwise.
